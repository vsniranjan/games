### BLACK JACK

* The goal of the game is to reach a score as close to 21 without bust (going above 21)

* The values of the cards are their face values weheras Jacks, Queens, and Kings each have a value of 10 and Aces can have a value of 1 or 11 depending upon the  situation

* Game starts with a player (a human) and a dealer (the computer) drawing two cards each and both of player's card are visible wheras only one of the dealers's cards are visible

* The player can either hit or stand while its their turn, if the player hits, they takes a card from the deck and if the player stands, their turn is over

* After the player is done playing, the dealer starts taking cards from the deck until their total value is 17, if dealer happens to get a total value of more than 21, the dealer busts

* Finally if the dealer and player hasn't busted, the person who has a higher total value wins and if the total values are equal then it is a draw.

* The concept of placing a bet is also present in the game, winning results in getting twice the amount the bet was placed on, loosing the game will make the player loose the amount the bet was placed on and a draw results in the player geting back the amount the bet was placed for
