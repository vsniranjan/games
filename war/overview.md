### WAR

* (This game is not meant to be played by users, it is only between two bots)

* A deck of cards is shuffled and is equally divided between both the players

* Each player plays a card and the player who plays the card of a higher value takes both the cards that were played

* When the cards played are equal, the players enter into a war, now each player takes 5 cards along with the cards the played and places them aside (a total of 12 cards)

* If a war occurs in the next round too, the players repeat the previous step

* Whoever wins the next round collects all the cards placed aside and the cards played

* This continues until a player has no cards or doesn't have enough cards to start a war
