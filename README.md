### GAMES

A repository for all the games that I make over time

Each folder contains a .py script for the game and a text file
with the basic over view of the game

(Some games are not playable for user, and is just a simulation of the game run by bots)

Currently includes the following games:

* Black Jack
* War (Not human playable)
* Tic-Tac-Toe

Have fun playing them and do let me know via an e-mail for any potential errors.
